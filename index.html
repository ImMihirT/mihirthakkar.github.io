							<h1>Mihir Thakkar</h1>
							<p>
								I knew the potential impact Machine Learning and AI could have on our lives when Prof Andrew Ng described AI as the new electricity.
								At that time (2nd year- bachelors), I didn’t know much about “how AI works” but it definitely sparked an interest in me to learn more about it. 
								Since then I have been learning and making projects on Machine Learning and AI systems. 
								Working on Machine Learning and AI systems, due to its ever growing power of predicting and understanding of “natural systems” has always made me feel exhilarating. 
								To hone my skills and understanding of the AI systems, I will be joining the MS in CS-DS program at Rutgers University in Fall'21. Until then, I am looking out for internship
								opportunities to gain some industrial experience in Machine Learning.  
								My immediate goal after masters is to become a Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist at a leading organization.
								When I am not pursuing my academic interests, I am either learning music or exploring the vastness of the universe by either reading books or watching YouTube!
